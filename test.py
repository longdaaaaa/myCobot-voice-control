"""
Test Script: Voice-to-MyCobot Command Construction (No Robot Movement)
This script records audio from the microphone, transcribes it using Whisper,
and then uses GPTâ€‘4 via the updated OpenAI API to convert the voice command
into a MyCobot320Socket API command. Finally, it prints the generated command.
